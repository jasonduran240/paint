# Paint Project
This a Paint app project made in **Tkinter and Python**. Tkinter is a Python binding to the _Tk GUI toolkit_. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 

Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. *The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.*

I converted it to an exe so it can be run without having to download python.

## Steps to follow:

* You can access to the entire code clicking on paint.py. 
* Download the paint.exe file which is inside dist folder.  
* Run the paint.exe file and enjoy your drawing skills!.
