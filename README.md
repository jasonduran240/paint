# paint
This a Paint project made in Python with Tkinter. Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.

I converted it to an exe so it can be run without having to download python.

Steps to follow up.

1: You can access to the entire code clicking on paint.py.
2: Download the paint.exe file which is inside dist folder.
3: Run the paint.exe file and enjoy your drawing skills!.
